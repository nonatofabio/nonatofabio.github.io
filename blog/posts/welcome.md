# Welcome to My Blog

I've been meaning to come back to writing for a while now. After years of building tools, shipping features, and breaking AI/ML infrastructure, I realized I learned a lot of stuff that might be useful to share.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover topics around my interests:

- **AI/ML Infrastructure** - Practical lessons from building and scaling ML systems at AWS
- **Developer Tools** - Building useful things like MCP servers and local AI tooling
- **Cybersecurity** - Threat intelligence and security applications of machine learning
- **Open Source** - Deep dives into projects I'm working on

## Why Write?

Writing forces clarity. When you have to explain something, you find gaps in your own understanding. I'm hoping this blog helps me think more clearly, while maybe helping others along the way.

## The Tech Stack

This blog is intentionally simple: Markdown files rendered client-side with marked.js, hosted on GitHub Pages. No build step, no database, no complexity. Just text files and a browser.

Sometimes the best tool is the simplest one that gets the job done.
